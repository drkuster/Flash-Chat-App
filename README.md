Flash Chat is a simple chat app that uses Google's Firebase authentication and storage. As soon as you sign up, you can send a message to anyone registered on the app! DISCLAIMER: The intellectual property of this app belongs to the London App Brewery, this is simply my rendition of it through following along with Angela Yu's Complete iOS 13 Bootcamp Course. However the course did not include the ability to actually message another person. I created that functionality on my own.
